        <h3>Change your seat!</h3>
        <p>
          You may be able to change your seat to one you prefer. May as well be as comfortable as possible for the
          long flight(s)! Use the "Airline Booking Ref" from your flight email
          (as seen in the pic below) to search for your itinerary.

        <h3>Baggage</h3>
        <p>
          Depending on what airline you are on, you usually get two complimentary checked bags up to 50lbs, as well as 1 bag
          + 1 personal item to carry on (total carry on weight 22lbs). The
          fees are hefty for exceeding the weight limits.

        <p>
          Historically, I have traveled with 2 checked rolling suitcases/bags, a
          medium-sized duffle bag, and a medium-sized backpack. It's basically
          as much as I can handle by myself. But remember, you can buy just
          about ANYTHING in HK, so if you don't need it, leave it at home.
          Number one rule of traveling: don't overpack.
        </p>
        <p>
          It is always possible that a checked bag could get lost, so it is
          extremely useful to have a full complement of essential clothes, food,
          chargers/power, and entertainment in your carry-on luggage.

        <h3>Frequent Flier program</h3>
        <p>
          A flight to HK is a huge number of miles! Take advantage of your
          airline's frequent flier program and ensure that your flight(s) counts
          toward your miles!
