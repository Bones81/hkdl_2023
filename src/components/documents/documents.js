            <h2 id="documents">Documents: a cheat sheet <em>updated 9/9/2022</em></h2>
            <p>In the work <strong>visa application</strong> and <strong>contract</strong> completion process, you will be asked to submit many documents: some as digital files, others as hard copies, and some in both forms.</p>
            <p>You will likely have to submit documents to both HKDL's HR department and a company called Fragomen that helps us get our work visas from the Immigration Dept.</p>
            <p>Eventually, when you FedEx anything to HK, make sure you <em>save your receipt(s)</em>, and make sure you <em>bring those receipts with you to HK</em> so that Disney can reimburse you.</p>
            <p>Here is a cheat sheet to help you collect the appropriate paperwork, even before you receive the official emails from HK Disney's HR peeps requesting all these items. Especially for newbies, it may take a hot minute to collect everything, so I recommend starting to collect these materials now so that you have them somewhat ready when it's time to mail them or email them. You'll have to plan for at least 4-6 weeks processing time from the date you mail off your visa application materials.</p>
            <h3>Items you'll likely need in <strong>digital form</strong>:</h3>
            <ol className='documents-ol'>
                <li><span>Copy of your passport info and signature page(s)</span></li>
                <li>(Returning carolers only) <span>Copy of your previous Hong Kong visa(s) and landing slip(s).</span></li>
                <li><span>Copy of your updated CV/resume</span></li>
                <li><span>Copy of your driver's license</span> (if you have one)</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Items you'll likely need <strong>hard copies</strong> of:</h3>
            <ol className='documents-ol'>
                <li><span>Passport-style photos</span> <em>You may have to purchase and take these photos at FedEx/Kinko's or any place that takes passport photos.</em></li>
                <li><span>Copy of your university degree/diploma(s) or academic transcript(s)</span>. <em>(This was one of the ones that took me a hot minute to find.)</em></li>
                <li>If you have obtained a degree or higher qualifications in a full-time and locally-accredited programme in Hong Kong, please provide evidence and copies of your Hong Kong student visa. <em>(Probably doesn't apply to any of us.)</em></li>
                <li><span>Copy of your relevant training or professional certificate(s)</span> (if any).</li>
                <li><span>Signed reference letters,</span> or copies of your signed employment contracts, staff identity cards, brochures, newspaper articles or pamphlets, etc. with your name or photos evidencing your relevant experience. John Hartmann has written recommendation letters for carolers, if you need one.</li>
                <li><span>Copies of a few of your performance photos with identifying info</span> (3 to 4 is sufficient).</li>
                <li><span>The visa application form ID990A (original required)</span> <em>(They will provide a link to this file, arguably the most important document of the bunch.)</em></li>
                <li><span>Copy of your signed HKITP employment contract.</span> </li>
            </ol>
            <h4 class="special-note">All of this is of course subject to change, and the info offered here is simply what previous carolers have experienced. Don't @ me if this year they suddenly require stuff that isn't listed on this webpage. 😜</h4>
